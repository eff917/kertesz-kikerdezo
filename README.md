# kertesz-kikerdezo
## Reason
To help my wife learn the latin names of plants.

## Goal
### Basic goals
- upload of pictures of plants
- Store plants' hungarian and latin name
- create lists of plants
- test yourself: choose a list, of which the plants' will be shown in random order. The pictures appear, and you have to type the correct case sensitive latin name of the plant.

### Later goals
- delete/modify plants, pictures, lists
- show statistics

## State
This project is my first venture into the world of frontend and backend development, and the quality of the code reflects that.

As I learn more and more, it will probably be cleaned up, and reorganized.

Technologies used:
- frontend: [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)
- backend: [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com), [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)
